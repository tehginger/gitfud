A simple recipe viewer.

This program is meant to fill in a lot of issues I have with existing recipe solutions.  Current recipe solutions are mainly web based and bloated.  To actually view a recipe, one has to sift through blog type articles and ads to even view the actual recipe.  My goal is to make this program as minimalist as possible, in all senses.



Development will be broken down into stages.

### Phase 1
* CLI Design
* Basic Functions
    * View
    * Add
    * Remove
    * Search
    * Import
    * Edit

### Phase 2
* GUI Design

### Phase 3
* Leverage of github or similar to host / share recipes with others within the program

### Phase 4
* Extra Features
    * Recipe reviews?
